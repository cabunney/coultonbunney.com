					<p class="h3 mt3 regular left-align">Iâ€™m a Product Designer based in Brooklyn, NY. I believe in a systems-based design approach that leads to efficiently designed tools that help users spend less time with their screens, not more. </p>
					<p class="h3 mt3 regular left-align">I joined <a href="http://www.flatiron.com">Flatiron Health</a> as the first designer back in 2015, and now I lead a team of six amazing folks. Together, we've helped oncology clinics find more patients for clincal trials, redesigned the electronic health record used by 1 in 5 US oncologists, created a design system built specifically for healthcare, and streamlined tools used to enable oncology research. And our work has only just begun...</p>
					<p class="h3 mt3 regular left-align">Before Flatiron, I co-founded an education-technology company now called <a href="http://www.informedk12.com">InformedK12</a> that automates tedious paperwork for K-12 educators and led design for <a href="http://www.lumobodytech.com">Lumo BodyTech</a>, where we made wearable devices to help alleviate chronic back-pain by retraining your posture and biomechanics.</p>
