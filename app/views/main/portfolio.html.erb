					<h1 class="left-align mt3">Hi, I'm Coulton Bunney.</h1>
					<!-- <p class="h3 mt3 regular left-align">I’m a Product Designer based in Brooklyn, NY.</p> -->
			
					<p class="h3 mt3 regular left-align">I am a Product and Design Lead at <a href="https://resolvetosavelives.org/">Resolve to Save Lives</a>, an initiative of the global non-profit Vital Strategies. At Resolve, I lead a team building technology that helps scale the capacity of public health departments across the United States to conduct case investigation and contact tracing for Covid-19. </p>

					<p class="h3 mt3 regular left-align">Previously, I was Senior Director of Product Design at <a href="http://www.flatiron.com">Flatiron Health</a>. I joined as the first designer in 2015, and eventually built a team of 16 amazing folks. Together, we helped oncology clinics find more patients for clinical trials, redesigned the electronic health record used by 1 in 5 US oncologists, created a design system built specifically for healthcare, and streamlined tools used to enable first of its kind oncology research using real-world data.</p>
					
					<p class="h3 mt3 regular left-align">Before Flatiron, I co-founded an education-technology company now called <a href="http://www.informedk12.com">InformedK12</a> that automates tedious paperwork for K-12 educators and led design for Lumo BodyTech, where we made wearable devices to help alleviate chronic back-pain by retraining your posture and biomechanics.</p>
